we've decided to work with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) dataset for Egyptian patients could have been influenced by several factors and considerations. Hepatitis C is a significant public health issue in Egypt, with a notably high prevalence rate. Researchers and healthcare professionals might choose to work with this dataset because it directly addresses a pressing health concern in the region.Also Funding and resource availability can influence research decisions. If funding was allocated for studying HCV in Egyptian patients, it would naturally lead to working with this dataset.
